# 🌍 GeoAI Toolkit 

**A Geographic Calculation Server for AI Models & Developers**

## 🚀 Overview

The GeoAI Toolkit is a specialized geographic computation server designed to provide AI models (LLMs, agents) and developers with powerful location-based calculation tools including geocoding, routing, distance calculations, and points-of-interest search.

## ✨ Features

### Core Capabilities
- **📍 Smart Geocoding**: Convert addresses ↔ coordinates with validation
- **📏 Distance Tools**: 
  - Straight-line (Haversine) distance
  - Route-based distance (driving/walking/biking)
- **🗺️ Route Planning**: 
  - Turn-by-turn navigation
  - Travel time estimation
  - Route geometry extraction
- **🏢 Points of Interest**: Find nearby locations with simulated data
- **🖼️ Route Visualization**: Generate interactive maps with custom overlays

### AI Integration Ready
- Structured JSON outputs perfect for AI consumption
- Session persistence for multi-step workflows
- Error-resistant data validation

## 🛠️ Installation
